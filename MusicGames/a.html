							Phigros is a rhythm game, a non-commercial music game created by Pigeon Games,
							a group of rhythm game enthusiasts that was founded through the bilibili video site.
							The unique feature of Phigros is that the spectrum is not stereotyped.
							Non-stereotypical spectrum means that the game spectrum can constantly change, for example,
							in the game, the decision line is not fixed in the same position, but will move up and down,
							rotate, jump,
							and even disappear, which makes the game difficult. Every move of the line in the game is
							set by the spectrographer,
							not random<br><br>
